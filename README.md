# CERN-Summer-Internship
LHeC is a proposed new facility at the existing LHC or the Future Circular Collider. The new accelerator facility may employ energy revocery to deliver electrons to a interaction point where they will collide with the proton beam. This will allow for new physics studies to be performed particularly those within the deep inelastic scattering regime. 

## Prerequisites

This project uses the BDSIM simulation tool and the accompanying pybdsim python tools. This can be accessed [here](http://www.pp.rhul.ac.uk/bdsim/manual/)

## Use

The study tools can be accessed from `LHeC_shieldingStudy` to perform studies on the possible shielding placement/geometry/material combinations in the LHeC interaction region. 

Some personal studies can be access in the examples folder.
